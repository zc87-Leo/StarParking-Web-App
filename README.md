# Star Town Parking System

Parking situation is stressful nowadays for many cities, so our goal is to build an application to improve the situation. ‘Star Town Parking’ is a web application for users to find real time available street parking spots. The application has a user-friendly interface which is based on **Spring Boot** and **Semantic-UI** framework. We utilized Google Map to show the parking spots and related information like availability and pay policy which is straightforward and easy to use for the users.
